# SaladChef

Unity Version: 2018.3.4f1

Work together, chop salad, serve hungry customers fast, earn points, power ups.

Making a local multiplayer co-op game I took liberty to make the timer and score common for both player so they work together to gain higher score together.

Game Time:120 sec
Star (*) is mentioned for chopped vegetable.

Done:
-Scene layout
-Player movement
-Inventory system
-Pickup/ Drop off
-Extra Plate Handler
-Trash Bin Handler
-Chopping Board Handler
-Customer Handler
-Score
-Timer
-Menu
-Highscore
-Power Ups
-Leaderboard

Future scope of improvement:
-Serving wrong food to customer should result in score penalty
